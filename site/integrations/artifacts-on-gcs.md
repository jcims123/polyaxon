You can use one or multiple buckets on Google Cloud Storage (GCS) to store logs, job outputs, and experiment artifacts.

## Create a Google cloud storage bucket

You should create a google cloud storage bucket (e.g. plx-artifacts), and you have to assign permission to the bucket.

Google cloud storage provides an easy way to download the access key as a JSON file. You should create a secret based on that JSON file.

## Create a secret on Kubernetes

You can create a secret with an env var of the content of the gcs-key.json:

 * `GC_KEYFILE_DICT` or `GOOGLE_KEYFILE_DICT`
 
Or you can create a secret to be mounted as a volume: 

 * `kubectl create secret generic gcs-secret --from-file=gc-secret.json=path/to/gcs-key.json -n polyaxon`


## Use the secret name and secret key in your data persistence definition

You can use the default mount path `/plx-context/.gc/gc-secret.json`.

```yaml
artifactsStore:
  name: gcs-artifacts
  kind: gcs
  schema:
    bucket: "gs://gcs-artifacts"
  secret:
    name: "gcs-secret"
    mountPath: /plx-context/.gc/gc-secret.json
```

You can also use a different mount path, e.g. `/etc/gcs/gc-secret.json`, in which case you need to provide an env var to tell the SDK where to look for the secret:

```bash
kubectl create configmap gc-key-path --from-literal GC_KEY_PATH="/etc/gcs/gc-secret.json" -n polyaxon
```

```yaml
artifactsStore:
  name: gcs-artifacts
  kind: gcs
  schema:
    bucket: "gs://gcs-datasets"
  secret:
    name: "gc-secret"
    mountPath: /etc/gcs
  configMap:
    name: gc-key-path
```

## Update/Install Polyaxon deployment

You can [deploy/upgrade](/docs/setup/) your Polyaxon CE or Polyaxon Agent deployment with access to the artifacts store.
